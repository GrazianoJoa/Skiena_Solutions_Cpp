# Skiena_Solutions_Cpp

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems and my own implementations of algorithms and data structures from the book:

**_The Algorithm Design Manual (3rd Edition)_**  
by **Steven S. Skiena**

## 📌 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- To deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures
- To practice implementing classical algorithms from scratch
- To build a reference collection of clean and well-structured solutions
- To improve problem-solving skills relevant to competitive programming and technical interviews

## 🧠 Contents

The repository includes:

- Solutions to selected problems from the book
- Implementations of algorithms and data structures discussed in the text
- Code written with an emphasis on clarity and correctness

The structure of the repository generally follows the organization of the book (chapters/topics).

## 💻 Languages & Tools

- **Primary language:** C++ / C 
- Standard libraries only (unless stated otherwise)
- Developed and tested on Linux

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are **my own interpretations** of the problems and are intended **for educational purposes only**.  
They are not official solutions and may differ from other valid approaches.

If you are currently studying the book, I encourage you to attempt solving the problems on your own before consulting this repository.

## 📚 Reference

Steven S. Skiena, *The Algorithm Design Manual*, 3rd Edition, Springer.

## 📬 Notes

This repository is a work in progress and may be updated over time as I continue studying the book.
